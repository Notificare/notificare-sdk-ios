## Features

**Push notifications**: Use the SDK to receive push notifications and automatically track its engagement.

**Push notifications UI**: We provide native screens and elements to display your push notifications and handle its actions with zero effort.

**Inbox**: Apps with a built-in message inbox enjoy higher conversions due to its nature of keeping messages around that can be opened as many times as users want. The SDK gives you all the tools necessary to build your inbox UI.
